Feature: Editing tickets 
	In order to alter ticket information
	As a user 
	I want a form to edit the tickets
	
	Background: 
		Given there is a user with the email address "user@ticketee.com" and password "password"
		And I am signed in as them
		Given there is a project called "TextMate 2"
		And "user@ticketee.com" can view the "TextMate 2" project
		And "user@ticketee.com" has created a ticket for this project:
		 | title          | description                   |
		 | Make it shiny! | Gradients! Starbursts! Oh my! |

		Given I am on the homepage 
		When I follow "TextMate 2"

		When I follow "Edit"
		
	Scenario: Updating a ticket 
		When I fill in "Title" with "Make it really shiny!"
		And I press "Update" 
		Then I should see "Ticket has been updated."
		And I should be on the "Make it really shiny!" ticket in the "TextMate 2" project
		And I should see "Make it really shiny!"
		But I should not see "Make it shiny!"
	
	Scenario: Updating a ticket with invalid information
		When I fill in "Title" with "" 
		And I press "Update" 
		Then I should see "Ticket has not been updated."
